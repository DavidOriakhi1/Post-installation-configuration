  Once I logged into osTicket as an admin, I configured the settings for the role of 'supreme admin' to be able to assign tickets to other agents

  Next, I created a new department named 'Systems Administrators' for the agents who have admin access to assign roles, attend to high level SLA's etc.

<p>
  Then, I created an agent under the name 'Jane Doe' as a member of the support team who the tickets will be assigned to giving them 'supreme admin' access also allowing them to assign, open and close tickets.
